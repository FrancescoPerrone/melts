    <h2>Dataset Overview</h2>
    <p>The original dataset contains seven clusters with 4 096 intensity values each. The table summarises the mean and maximum intensities. The Map 1 dataset has much lower intensities (roughly 2–5 % of the original) but retains similar relative patterns.</p>

  <section id="correlation">
    <h2>Cluster Correlation &amp; Analytical Methods</h2>
    <p>We computed descriptive statistics and pairwise correlations for both datasets. In the original dataset, clusters 0, 2, 4, 5 and 6 are highly correlated (r &gt; 0.96), indicating similar Si‑dominated spectra. Cluster 1 exhibits a distinct spectral shape (low correlation with others). In the Map 1 dataset, all clusters are more homogeneous with correlations above 0.86, reflecting the lower intensity and reduced variability.</p>
    <p>Statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation and integrated area were calculated for each cluster. Ratios of Map 1 to original means range from 1–5 %, confirming the lower absolute intensities. Manual peak curation was used to derive element fractions for stoichiometric analysis.</p>

    <h2>Stoichiometric Composition by Cluster</h2>
    <p>A stacked bar chart displays the relative fractions (percentage) of key elements (Al, Si, P, Cl and S) in each cluster. Values are derived from manually curated peak intensities and normalised to 100 %.</p>

  <section id="conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusions &amp; Next Steps</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Cluster 1 consistently exhibits the highest mean and maximum intensities, signalling a distinct composition.</li>
      <li>The Map 1 dataset has intensities roughly an order of magnitude lower but preserves relative differences; Cluster 4 has the largest peak.</li>
      <li>Stoichiometric analysis reveals that Si is ubiquitous, with P, Cl, Al and S appearing in specific clusters, suggesting mixtures of quartz, phosphosilicates and sulphides.</li>
      <li>Future work: correlate clusters with spatial morphology, apply quantitative spectral fitting and cross‑map machine‑learning models.</li>
